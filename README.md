# API-Onion-Architecture-ProjecOnion Architecture is an architectural approach used to organize and design software applications. This approach divides the application into layers, arranging the business logic and other components in a specific order. The fundamental philosophy of Onion Architecture is to invert dependencies and isolate the inner layers of the application from the outer layers.

In Onion Architecture, there are typically four main layers:

Core Layer: This is the innermost layer of the application and contains the business logic. Business rules, entity classes, repository interfaces, and operations are defined here. This layer is independent and does not have dependencies on other layers.

Application Layer: This layer combines the user interface (UI) and business logic (Core). It is used to process user requests, invoke business logic, and expose results to the outside world.

Infrastructure Layer: This layer manages external dependencies. Tasks like database access, communication with external services, logging, and more are handled in this layer. It has external dependencies and interacts with other layers.

Presentation Layer: This layer is responsible for creating the user interface. Components that manage user interaction, such as UI in web applications or window interfaces in desktop applications, reside in this layer.

The key advantages of Onion Architecture include:

Minimizing external dependencies and isolating the application's core logic.
Ensuring testability and ease of maintenance.
Resisting changes effectively.
Being technology-agnostic, making it applicable to various platforms and technologies.
This approach is particularly useful for large and complex software projects and aims to create a clean and well-organized codebase. The goal of Onion Architecture is to better organize application layers, core business logic, and infrastructure and promote sustainable software development.
